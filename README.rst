Philosphy
---------

Reread the tag line above!
It is the essence of the philosophy behind this tool.
More precisely:

 1. This is primarily **command-line**. The web is secondary.
 2. "**A** developer" means big project management is out of scope.
 3. Lots of shortcuts and defering for **lazy** devs like me.
 4. End users, managers and translators should use something else.
